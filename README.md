4.	Brief summary (3-5 sentences) describing what you learned about Jenkins navigation.
     1.	I learned how to navigate the Jenkins dashboard, which includes understanding key components like the job list, buildqueue, and          build executor status. 
     2.	I  explored how to create a new pipelinejob and configure it using a simple scripted pipeline .
     3.	I also learned how to monitor build status and view detailed logs through the console output.
     4.	Additionally, I explored basic Jenkins settings through the “Manage Jenkins” section to understand system and tool            
        configurations.
